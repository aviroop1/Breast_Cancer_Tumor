# Breast_Cancer_Tumor
Analyze Malignant and Benign Tumors

<h3> Objective </h3>

To distinguish between malignant and benign tumors based on the cell nuclei characteristics. 

<h3> Description </h3>

The characteristics are derived from a digitized image of a breast mass.

Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
